# Arduino-Voice-Control-Python-Integration
This repository contains code for implementing speech recognition using both Arduino and Python. The combination of Arduino and Python allows for real-time control of hardware components such as LEDs and servos based on voice commands captured through a microphone.

Usage:

Arduino Setup: Connect the Arduino board to the hardware components (servo motor, LED) as specified in the code. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board using the Arduino IDE.
Python Installation: Install the necessary Python libraries (SpeechRecognition, PySerial) using pip:  pip install SpeechRecognition pyserial
Execution: Run the Python script to start listening for voice commands. Speak clearly and wait for the system to recognize the commands. The Arduino board will respond accordingly, controlling the connected hardware components.
